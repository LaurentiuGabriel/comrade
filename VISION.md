# Comrade Vision

**Mission:** Empower teams to work 1000× more effectively with AI assistance.

**How:** Comrade gives AI agents access to the tools your team already uses, learning from interactions to automate increasingly complex workflows. The more you collaborate with Comrade, the more it adapts to your team's unique patterns.

**Today:** Comrade provides the simplest interface to AI-powered workflows:

1. **Zero-friction setup** — Your existing configuration works out of the box
2. **Chat access** — WhatsApp and Telegram integration ready to go
3. **Cloud-ready** — Every app doubles as a client; deploy to the cloud and access from anywhere

Comrade helps users deploy agentic workflows to their teams. It works alongside AI coding platforms and APIs, maximizing native primitives while providing a thin, elegant layer.

In other words:
- The AI engine is the **brain**.
- Comrade is the **experience**: onboarding, safety, permissions, progress tracking, artifacts, and a polished UI.

Comrade competes conceptually with closed-source alternatives but stays open, local-first, and extensible.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing command-line interfaces or terminal workflows.
- Creating bespoke "magic" capabilities that don't map to standard APIs.
